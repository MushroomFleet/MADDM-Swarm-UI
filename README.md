# MADDM-Swarm

**Multi-Agent Decision-Making Swarm** - An AI coordination system implementing **stigmergic architecture** and **ADDM (Adaptive Decision-Making) loop control** for parallel multi-specialist execution. Harness the power of emergent intelligence where AI specialists coordinate indirectly through environmental signals (like ant pheromone trails), enabling parallel task resolution with adaptive resonance, quality-based selection, and intelligent loop termination.

## üß† How It Works

### Dual Intelligence Architecture

MADDM-Swarm combines two complementary AI coordination approaches:

#### 1. Stigmergic Coordination
Unlike traditional AI orchestration that uses direct communication or central control, MADDM-Swarm employs **stigmergy** - indirect coordination through environmental signals. AI specialists modify their shared environment (signal boundaries) which influences other specialists' behavior, creating emergent coordination patterns similar to ant colonies building complex structures through pheromone trails.

#### 2. ADDM Loop Regulation (New!)
The **Adaptive Decision-Making (ADDM)** system provides intelligent loop control using **drift-diffusion models** to determine when content is ready for delivery. Instead of fixed iteration limits, ADDM continuously evaluates content quality and decides whether to:
- **Enhance**: Continue improving the current response
- **Research**: Gather additional information
- **Complete**: Deliver to user (end loop)

### Parallel Multi-Specialist Execution
- **Adaptive Resonance Layer:** Selects top N specialists most resonant with your task
- **Stigmergic Signals:** Each specialist independently chooses approaches based on environmental signals
- **Parallel Execution:** All selected specialists execute simultaneously for maximum efficiency
- **Quality Voting:** Best response selected based on content quality scores
- **ADDM Loop Control:** Intelligent determination of when iteration should stop
- **Distributed Learning:** All results contribute to system evolution

## üß™ ADDM Technical Details

### Decision-Making Process

The ADDM system uses **drift-diffusion models** - mathematical models inspired by neural decision-making:

1. **Content Analysis:** Evaluates current response quality and completeness
2. **Evidence Accumulation:** Builds parallel decision processes for each option
3. **Diffusion Process:** Adds realistic noise and timing to decision simulation
4. **Threshold Crossing:** First decision to reach confidence threshold wins
5. **Quality Termination:** Content delivered when standards are met

### Quality Assessment Factors
- **Content Length:** Substantive responses favor completion
- **Structural Organization:** Well-formatted content scores higher
- **Confidence Calibration:** User-adjustable quality thresholds
- **Iteration Context:** Later iterations gradually favor completion
- **Workflow Adaptation:** Different criteria for research vs news content

### Configurable Parameters
- **Max Iterations:** Safety limit (but ADDM may complete earlier)
- **Confidence Threshold:** Quality requirement for completion
- **Workflow Mode:** Task-specific quality assessment
- **Decision Timing:** Simulated reaction time parameters
