# Phase 3: Hybrid Orchestrator Parallel Logic

**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE  
**Time Estimate:** 90 min  
**Actual Time:** ~30 min

## Objective
Add parallel coordination capability to `HybridSwarmOrchestrator` that selects top N specialists and independently determines approach for each.

## Files Modified
- ✅ `src/core/hybrid-orchestrator.ts` - Added `getParallelCoordination()` method

## Implementation Details

### New Method: `getParallelCoordination(task, parallelCount)`

**Step 1: Find Top Specialists**
- Calls `adaptiveLayer.findTopSpecialists(taskSignature, parallelCount)`
- Extracts task signature from context
- Gets top N specialists by resonance score
- Logs specialist selection with resonance values

**Step 2: Independent Approach Selection**
- For each specialist:
  - Calls `approachManager.matchApproaches(task, 0.3, 3)`
  - Uses stigmergic signals via `selectWithSignals()` to choose approach
  - Falls back to 'fallback' if no matches
  - Creates `CoordinationResult` for this specialist

**Step 3: Return ParallelCoordinationResult**
- Primary coordination is first specialist (highest resonance)
- Remaining specialists in `alternativeSpecialists` array
- Each contains: `specialistId`, `approachId`, `qualityTarget`, `approachMetadata`

### Key Design Decisions

1. **Stigmergic Independence:** Each specialist independently selects approach using signal blending
2. **Reuse Existing Logic:** Leverages `selectWithSignals()` method for consistency
3. **Primary + Alternatives:** Returns format matching `ParallelCoordinationResult` interface
4. **Logging:** Comprehensive logging for debugging parallel coordination

### Code Quality
- ✅ Type-safe with TypeScript interfaces
- ✅ Consistent with existing `getCoordination()` method
- ✅ Reuses existing methods (`selectWithSignals`, `matchApproaches`)
- ✅ Comprehensive console logging

## Testing Strategy
- [ ] Unit test: Verify N coordinations returned
- [ ] Unit test: Verify each specialist gets independent approach
- [ ] Integration test: Full parallel coordination flow
- [ ] Manual test: Check console logs for parallel coordination

## Performance Considerations
- Sequential approach selection (could be parallelized in future)
- Reuses existing caches in `approachManager`
- Logarithmic complexity: O(N × log(M)) where N = specialists, M = approaches

## Next Phase
**Phase 4:** Create `useParallelChat.ts` hook for executing N specialists in parallel with `Promise.all()`

## Notes
- Method mirrors existing `getCoordination()` structure for consistency
- Each specialist's perspective preserved through independent signal reading
- Ready for parallel LLM execution in Phase 4
