# Phase 4: Parallel Streaming Execution

**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE  
**Time Estimate:** 90 min  
**Actual Time:** ~45 min

## Objective
Create hook for executing N specialists in parallel with streaming, timeout handling, and quality-based selection.

## Files Created
- ✅ `src/hooks/useParallelChat.ts` - New parallel execution hook
- ✅ `src/hooks/index.ts` - Export new hook

## Implementation Details

### Core Methods

#### `executeSingleSpecialist(coordination, prompt, timeoutMs)`
- Creates timeout promise (rejects after timeoutMs)
- Executes specialist with streaming via OpenRouterClient
- Races execution against timeout using `Promise.race()`
- Analyzes content quality with ContentAnalyzer
- Returns `SpecialistExecutionResult` with quality score
- Gracefully handles errors (returns success: false)

#### `executeParallel(coordination, prompt, timeoutMs)`
- Builds array of all coordinations (primary + alternatives)
- Executes all specialists concurrently with `Promise.all()`
- Logs execution progress and results
- Calls `selectBestResult()` to pick winner
- Returns `ParallelExecutionResult` with all results + selected winner

#### `selectBestResult(results)`
- Filters successful results (success: true)
- Sorts by quality score descending
- Returns highest quality result
- Falls back to first result if all failed

### Key Features
- ✅ True parallel execution with `Promise.all()`
- ✅ Per-specialist timeout protection
- ✅ Graceful error handling (failures don't block others)
- ✅ Quality-based result selection
- ✅ Returns ALL results for distributed learning
- ✅ Comprehensive console logging

### Error Handling
- Timeout errors caught per specialist
- API errors caught per specialist
- Failed specialists don't block successful ones
- All results returned for learning (even failures)

## Testing Strategy
- [ ] Unit test: Verify parallel execution with mock specialists
- [ ] Unit test: Verify timeout handling
- [ ] Unit test: Verify quality voting logic
- [ ] Integration test: Full parallel flow with real API
- [ ] Manual test: Check console logs during parallel execution

## Performance Characteristics
- **Parallel speedup:** N specialists execute in ~same time as 1
- **Timeout safety:** Individual specialists can't hang entire batch
- **Quality improvement:** Best of N results selected automatically
- **Learning data:** All results preserved for system evolution

## Dependencies
- Reuses `OpenRouterClient` for streaming
- Reuses `ContentAnalyzer` for quality estimation
- Integrates with `useSystemStore` for model selection
- Uses `useApiKey` for authentication

## Next Phase
**Phase 5:** Update ChatInterface to conditionally route to parallel execution based on `config.parallelConfig.enabled`

## Notes
- Hook follows same pattern as `useStreamingChat` for consistency
- Quality voting is simple (highest score wins) - can be enhanced later
- All specialists stream independently (no interference)
- Ready for integration into chat interface
